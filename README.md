# semi-fixed-scrolling
Semi fixed scrolling. Sticking elements when they reach limit.

# Why fixed position elements are harder to incorporate? 
Because their width and postition gets relative to the window position and not its parent element's position. When you apply fixed position to an element it might loose its width and its initial position.
